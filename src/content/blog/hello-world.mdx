# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using MDX format. MDX allows us to write content using Markdown syntax while also being able to use React components.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write content using familiar Markdown syntax
- **React Components**: Embed React components directly in your content
- **Tailwind Styling**: Beautiful styling with Tailwind CSS
- **Tag System**: Organize posts with tags

## Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about:

- Web Development
- React
- Next.js
- And much more!
